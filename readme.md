# üè† Rental Scrapers for Tenant Empowerment

**Contributors:** Maiktreya & Regex Wizard

This project is designed to empower tenants and small-scale users by providing accessible scrapers for property listings on Airbnb and Idealista. With rising housing prices and unfair rental practices, access to data is crucial. This tool allows individuals to gather data on available properties without being subject to opaque an advert based practices.

**Note:** This is not intended for corporate-scale use or to exploit property data on a large scale. The scrapers are built for **personal use**, focusing on the right to information for tenants.
